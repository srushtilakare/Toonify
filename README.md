# Toonify – AI-Based Image Transformation Tool

Toonify is a full-stack AI-powered web application that converts real-world images into cartoon-style effects using computer vision techniques. The platform allows users to upload images, apply different cartoon filters, compare results side-by-side, and securely download the transformed image after payment.

This project is built using the **MERN stack** for the web application and **OpenCV** for image processing.
